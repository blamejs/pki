# Changelog

All notable changes to `@blamejs/pki` are documented here. The format
follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); this
project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## v0.1.1 — 2026-07-04

First published release of the 0.1.x foundation.

### Changed

- First release published to npm. The toolkit surface is the 0.1.x foundation — pki.asn1 (strict DER codec), pki.oid (OID ↔ name registry), pki.x509.parse (DER/PEM certificate parsing), and pki.webcrypto (a W3C SubtleCrypto engine over node:crypto with ML-DSA/SLH-DSA signatures alongside the full classical set) — now available on npm with a SLSA provenance attestation, and served as the pkijs.com documentation container.

## v0.1.0 — 2026-07-04

Initial foundation — a PQC-first WebCrypto engine, a strict DER codec, an OID registry, and X.509 certificate parsing.

### Added

- pki.webcrypto — a zero-dependency W3C Web Cryptography API (Crypto / SubtleCrypto / CryptoKey) built on Node's native node:crypto. PQC-first without being PQC-only: ML-DSA-44/65/87 and SLH-DSA signatures sit alongside the full classical set — RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5, RSA-PSS, RSA-OAEP, ECDSA, ECDH, Ed25519/Ed448, AES-GCM/CBC/CTR/KW, HMAC, HKDF, PBKDF2, and the SHA family (including legacy SHA-1) — plus ML-KEM key generation. Every key and signature it emits is OpenSSL/NSS-interoperable.
- pki.asn1 — a strict, fail-closed DER decoder and canonical encoder with a navigable node tree, typed readers (integer, boolean, OID, bit string, octet string, time, string), and value builders. Rejects indefinite length, non-minimal encodings, and trailing bytes, and enforces size and depth caps (X.690).
- pki.oid — a two-way OID ↔ name registry with dotted/arc conversion, seeded with RFC 5280 attribute types and extensions, the classical signature/public-key/digest algorithms, and the NIST post-quantum arcs (ML-DSA, ML-KEM, SLH-DSA).
- pki.x509.parse — parse DER or PEM X.509 certificates into structured, validated fields: version, serial, signature algorithm, issuer/subject distinguished names, validity window as Date values, subject public-key info, and the extension list, with the exact tbsCertificate bytes exposed for downstream verification.
- pki.C — functional scale constants (C.TIME.*, C.BYTES.*) and shared codec limits.
- pki.errors — a PkiError taxonomy with a defineClass factory and stable domain/reason codes.
- pki command-line front-end (version, oid, parse).

### Security

- The DER decoder is fail-closed: non-DER shapes are rejected and size/depth caps are enforced before the parser walks the input, so a hostile length prefix cannot become a decoder denial-of-service.
- The crypto engine is fail-closed: an unknown algorithm, curve, or format is rejected rather than silently downgraded, and every sign/verify path returns a real verdict or throws.
